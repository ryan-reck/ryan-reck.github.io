Projects
========

Some things I've done in my free time. I should get around to sharing them all eventually.

 * [https://github.com/ryan-reck/alpha-slots](alpha-slots) - a slot machine with letters and words instead of pictures.
 * gallery-sharing-plugin - A [http://maemo.org/](Maemo) libsharing plugin for sharing photos to a [http://galleryproject.org/](Gallery3) server.
 * gallery-client - A python client application for Gallery3's REST API.
 * reader - A simple ereader application written for reading [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page) books on my n900.

About me
========

I'm a software developer who enjoys learning new languages/libraries/tools. I work on java web-services currently but most of my personal projects are in python. If it's not obvious, I'm addicted to my aging n900 and still write most of my stuff for it or on it, or both. Usually both.
